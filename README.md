## Overview

The US Arrest dataset contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents, for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. The dataset also includes the percentage of the population living in urban areas.

## Contents

- `US_Arrests_PCA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for EDA and PCA.
- `UsArrests.csv`: CSV file containing the raw data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involved:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Statistical summary and visualization of individual variables.
- Correlation analysis between variables.
- Identification of outliers and anomalies.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA was performed to:
- Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
- Identify patterns and relationships between variables.
- Visualize the data in lower-dimensional space.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to use

To reproduce the analysis or explore the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git clone <https://github.com/fortune-ncube/US_Arrests_PCA>```

2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Open the  **automobile_eda.ipynb** Jupyter Notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Execute the code cells to run the analysis and visualize the results.

   OR
   
1. Install the required dependencies:
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `US_Arrests_PCA.ipynb` to explore the dataset and analysis results.

## Results

- EDA revealed interesting patterns and insights into the relationships between different variables.
- PCA provided a simplified representation of the dataset, highlighting the most significant components.
- Insights gained from the analysis can be used for further investigation or decision-making.
