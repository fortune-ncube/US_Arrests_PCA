# US Arrest Dataset Analysis

This project explores the US Arrest dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and principal component analysis (PCA).

## Overview

The US Arrest dataset contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents, for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. The dataset also includes the percentage of the population living in urban areas.

## Contents

- `US_Arrest_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for EDA and PCA.
- `us_arrest_dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the raw data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involved:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Statistical summary and visualization of individual variables.
- Correlation analysis between variables.
- Identification of outliers and anomalies.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA was performed to:
- Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
- Identify patterns and relationships between variables.
- Visualize the data in lower-dimensional space.

## Results

- EDA revealed interesting patterns and insights into the relationships between different variables.
- PCA provided a simplified representation of the dataset, highlighting the most significant components.
- Insights gained from the analysis can be used for further investigation or decision-making.
